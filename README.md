# Find-peaks-and-curve-fitting
## Introduction to this program
This is a multi-peak XRD fitting program developed for multi-file analysis. For peak analysis, the program provides three fitting models: Gaussian, Lorentzian and PseudoVoigt, as they are the commonly used profile functions. This program can analyse multitude of data sets by fitting the peaks observed in X-ray diffraction measurements and determine the information within an individual sets of peaks, specifically the (a) position of the peak, (b) full width at half maximum and (c) area under the peak.
